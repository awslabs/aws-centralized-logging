# AWS Centralized Logging Solution

Centralized Logging is a reference implementation that provides a foundation for logging to a centralized account. Customers can leverage the solution to index CloudTrail Logs, CW Logs, VPC Flow Logs on a ElasticSearch domain. The logs can then be searched on different fields.

The solution supports spoke accounts and regions and gives a single pane to gain actionable insight into the logs using Kibana.

_Note:_ For any relavant information outside the scope of this readme, please refer to the solution landing page and implementation guide.

## Installing pre-packaged solution template

- Primary Template: [aws-centralized-logging.template](./templates/aws-centralized-logging.template)

- Demo Template: [Demo.template](./templates/aws-centralized-logging-demo.template)

## Customization

- Prerequisite: Node.js>10

### Setup

Clone the repository and run the following commands to install dependencies, format and lint as per the project standards

```
npm i
npm run prettier-format
npm run lint
```

### Changes

You may make any needed change as per your requirement. If you want to customize the Centralized Logging opinionated defaults, you can modify the [solution manifest file](./source/resources/lib/manifest.json). You can also control sending solution usage metrics to aws-solutions, from the manifest file.

```
"solutionVersion": "%%VERSION%%", #provide a valid value eg. v1.0
"sendMetric": "Yes",
```

Addtionally, you can customize the code and add any extension to the solution. Please review our [feature request guidelines](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), if you want to submit a PR.

### Unit Test

You can run unit tests with the following command from the root of the project

```
 npm run test
```

### Build

You can build lambda binaries with the following command from the root of the project

```
 npm run build
```

### Deploy

Run the following command from the root of the project. Deploys all the primary solution components needed for centralized logging. **Deploy in Primary Account**

```
cd source/resources
npm i
```

```
./node_modules/aws-cdk/bin/cdk bootstrap --profile <PROFILE_NAME>
./node_modules/aws-cdk/bin/cdk synth CL-PrimaryStack
./node_modules/aws-cdk/bin/cdk deploy CL-PrimaryStack --parameters AdminEmail=<EMAIL> --parameters SpokeAccounts=<ACCOUNT-ID-1,ACCOUNT-ID-2...> --parameters JumpboxKey=<EC2_KEY_PAIR> --parameters JumpboxDeploy='Yes' --profile <PROFILE_NAME>
```

_Note:_ for PROFILE_NAME, substitute the name of an AWS CLI profile that contains appropriate credentials for deploying in your preferred region.

## Sample Scenario (Enabling CloudWatch logging on Elasticsearch domain)

The default deployment uses opinionated values as setup in [solution manifest file](./source/resources/lib/manifest.json). In this scenario let's say we want to enable CloudWatch logging for ES domain.

You would need to update the **ESDomain** resource in cl-primary-stack.ts as below:

```
 logging: {
        slowSearchLogEnabled: true,
        appLogEnabled: true,
        slowIndexLogEnabled: true,
      },
```

## File structure

AWS Centralized Logging solution consists of:

- cdk constructs to generate needed resources
- helper for bootstrapping purposes like creating CloudWatch Logs Destinations
- transformer to translate kinesis data stream records into Elasticsearch documents
